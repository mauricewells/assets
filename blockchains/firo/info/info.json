  "description": "Firo (FIRO) is an open-source privacy-focused cryptocurrency token that launched in Sep 2016. Rebranded from Zcoin in 2020, Firo introduced trustless setup with the Sigma privacy protocol as well as MTP which prevents decentralization through ASICs. Firo is also the creator of the Lelantus privacy protocol which improves Sigma's privacy and functionality. With the Lelantus protocol, only the sender and receiver would be able to ascertain the exchange of funds in a given transaction, as no transaction histories are linked to the actual coins.",
